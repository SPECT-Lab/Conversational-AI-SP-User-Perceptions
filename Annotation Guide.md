# Annotation Guide

Classify posts as '**S\&P'** (Security and Privacy) or '**not-S\&P**'.

## Instructions

* Read each post carefully.  
* Determine whether the post discusses any aspect of security or privacy related to conversational AI agents.
* Label the post as 'S\&P' or 'not-S\&P'.

**Conversational AI Agents:** AI systems that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage users in natural language across multiple modalities (e.g., text and voice). These platforms cover diverse interfaces - ranging from chatbots to agents that include task completion capabilities. Examples include ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.

## S\&P Label

Posts should be labeled as 'S\&P' if they discuss or are related to:

* **Data Collection:**  Concerns about the collection of personal data (e.g., PII, health data, voice data), intellectual property (e.g., company data, code, ideas), or other sensitive data (e.g., location, internet activity).  
* **Use of User Data for Training:** Concerns about whether and how user chats or data are used to train or improve AI models and associated risks including human review and memorization.  
* **Third-party Data Sharing:** Issues related to data sharing with third-parties including affiliates, data brokers, advertisers, third-party plugins, and other users, including fears of data being sold.  
* **Custom GPTs and other LLM-powered chatbots:** Worries about data leaks, prompt injection vulnerabilities, or inappropriate access to sensitive data in custom GPTs or other LLM-powered chatbots.  
* **Compliance with Legal Standards:** Discussions around GDPR, HIPAA, or other legal requirements for data protection and user privacy.  
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Concerns over security bugs, data breaches, or potential platform vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive user information.  
* **Transparency and Data Controls:** Frustrations over opt-out policies, perceived loss of functionality for opting out of data collection, lack of transparency in privacy settings, or misleading changes in privacy policy terms.  
* **Users’ S\&P Attitudes, Preferences or Behaviors:** Observations about users’ S\&P:  
  * attitudes (e.g., privacy-conscious, privacy-dismissive),  
  * preferences (e.g., local LLMs instead of cloud-based, preferences related to GDPR compliance), and/or  
  * behaviors (e.g., implementing privacy safeguards such as scrubbing inputs of sensitive information before passing to GPT).

**Note:** Posts that discuss security and privacy of conversational AI agents, apart from the aforementioned areas, should also be labeled as 'S\&P'.

## Not-S\&P Label

Posts should be labeled as 'not-S\&P' if they discuss topics unrelated to security or privacy, including:

* **Functionality:** General questions or comments about how AI chatbots work or their features that do not pertain to security or privacy.  
* **Performance Issues:** Complaints or observations about the performance, speed, or quality of the AI responses.  
* **User Experience:** Discussions about the overall user experience with the chatbot that do not involve data security or privacy concerns.  
* **Technical Bugs:** Issues or bugs related to the technical operation of the chatbot that do not affect security or privacy.  
* **General AI Topics:** Topics related to AI ethics, general AI development, or other non-security/privacy aspects.  
* **Jailbreaks:** Attempts to bypass AI safeguards to make the chatbot generate offensive, toxic, or inappropriate content.  
* **General News Sharing:** General AI updates, industry news, or announcements that do not specifically cover security/privacy concerns and attitudes of users.
