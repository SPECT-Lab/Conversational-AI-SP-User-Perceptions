You are an experienced security and privacy researcher, tasked with classifying Reddit post and comments into security and privacy themes based on their content. The themes and sub-themes are related to users’ concerns about conversational AI agents and platforms like ChatGPT.

Given a post, your task is to:

	1.	Read it carefully.
	2.	For each theme, determine whether it is present in the post. Indicate ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for each theme.

Note that each post may be assigned multiple themes.

Your goal is to minimize false negatives and false positives. Base your classification solely on the content of the post and the theme descriptions provided below.

Themes:

	1.	Data Collection

        A. Personal data: The post expresses concern about the collection of personal data by AI platforms including concerns about:
            i)  the collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII) e.g., name, email, phone number, etc.,
            ii) voice data (and listening), or
            ii) the tracking or surveillance of user activity and behaviors (e.g., browsing search history and location data).

        B. Proprietary information: The post expresses concern about the collection or stealing of:
            i)  company or work-related data (e.g., business plans, internal communications, trade secrets, code, etc.}, or
            ii) intellectual product including ideas (e.g., startup or buisness idea) and creative works (e.g., novels).

    2.	Data Usage

        A. Model training: The post expresses specific privacy concerns regarding how user data might be used to train AI models. These concerns include worries about:
            i)  humans viewing user conversations for annotation, or
            ii) data exposure to other users through model training. 
            
            Do not say "Yes" if the post only states that data is used to improve or train models without raising a privacy concern.

        B. Third-party sharing: The post express concern about user data being shared with third parties, including
            i)   affiliates,
            ii)  data brokers and advertisers (the post may raise concerns about 'selling', or 'monetization' of data without explicitly mentioning data brokers and advertisers),
            iii)  government authorities, and
            iv)  other users
	
    3.	Data retention: The post expresses concern about:
            i)   how long user data is stored by AI systems,
            ii)  retention of data after deletion, or
            iii) user ability to remove data from the platform.

            Do not say "Yes" if the post only mentions that data is retained without raising a privacy concern.
	
    4.	Security Vulnerabilities

        A. Platform security: The post expresses concern about the security of conversational AI platforms, which may include concerns about:
            i)  software bugs and glitches with security implications, or
            ii) data breaches that may expose sensitive user data.

            Do not say "Yes" if the post discusses non-security-related platform issues.

        B. LLM-powered applications: The post expresses concern about how applications such customer service bots, and Custom GPTs can be manipulated using prompt injections or jailbreaks.

        C. LLM-generated code: The post expresses concern about security vulnerabilities present in code generated by LLMs, including:
            i)  the presence of security bugs, and 
            ii) risks involved with deployment of LLM-generated code in production systems.
            
            Do not say "Yes" if the post mentions about the security of code which is not generated by AI.
	
    5.	Legal Compliance
    
        A. GDPR: The post expresses concern about the compliance of AI platforms with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

        B. HIPAA: The post expresses concern about:
            i)  the compliance of AI platforms with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or 
            ii) the use of conversational AI agents in medical or therapeutic contexts.
	
    6.	Transparency and Control: The post expresses concern about limited clarity or control over data privacy options on conversational AI platforms including concerns about:
        	i)   confusing or hard-to-access data controls for managing data sharing, 
        	ii)  dark patterns that limit functionality or introduce bugs when users opt out of data sharing, or
        	iii) frequent privacy policy updates that reset data-sharing settings or create more confusion.

        Do not say “Yes” if the post only mentions privacy settings or has general policy inquiries without raising specific concerns.
